*Allocation suggestion*: 10 % of capital for each of the **9 individual names** (~€400 each). This totals **€3 600** (≈90 % of the €4 000).  

> *Note*: Some stocks (e.g., Illumina, CRISPR Therapeutics) may exceed the €1 000 tax‑free allowance if held in a taxable account. The remaining €400 can be retained within the tax‑free account.

### 2.2 ETFs (≈70 % of the portfolio)

| ETF | Ticker | Focus | Suggested Allocation | Key Source |
|-----|--------|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Invesco QQQ | QQQ | US tech giants (NASDAQ‑100). | 20 % (€800) |
| ARK Innovation ETF | ARKK | AI, robotics, genomics, fintech. | 10 % (€400) |

> *Tax‑free allowance*: ETFs like QQQ, ARKK, SOXX, etc., often deliver capital gains and dividends. Allocating the most taxable stocks (NVDA, GOOGL, TSMC, ASML) to the custodial account maximises the benefit of the €1 000 allowance. The remaining ETFs can be placed in a taxable account.

## 3. Tax Implications & Regulatory Considerations for a Child’s Investment Account

| Topic | Key Points | Practical Advice | Source |
|-------|------------|------------------|--------|
| **Custodial / Custodian Accounts** | • UK: Junior ISA (tax‑free £2 000 annual allowance). <br>• EU: Custodial accounts under each country’s legislation (e.g., Germany’s „Handelsgesellschaft für Kinder“). | • Open a Junior ISA if residing in the UK. <br>• For other EU countries, use a local custodial account and check minimum investment amounts. | [15] |
| **Tax‑free Allowance** | • €1 000 per year (equivalent to £2 000 in UK). <br>• Covers capital gains and dividends earned within the custodial account. | • Prioritise high‑dividend or high‑growth securities that will generate gains in the custodial account. <br>• Document all purchases and sales for reporting. | [15] |
| **Income Tax on Dividends & Capital Gains** | • Dividends: 0 % in UK Junior ISA; 25 % dividend allowance in standard accounts. <br>• Capital gains: 0 % in Junior ISA; 10 %/20 % tax rates for UK residents. | • Use the tax‑free account to shield gains. <br>• If taxable, consider holding less‑traded, high‑gain ETFs to minimise number of taxable events. | [15] |
| **Withholding Tax on International Dividends** | • U.S. dividends: 30 % withholding, 15 % for UK residents under treaty. <br>• EU dividends: Generally lower withholding (e.g., 5 % for EU‑to‑EU). | • Use ETFs domiciled in the U.S. but listed in Europe to apply treaty benefits. | [16] |
| **Holding Period & Capital Gains Tax** | • Long‑term (≥ 12 months) may qualify for lower tax treatment in some jurisdictions. | • Rebalance holdings every 12–18 months to realise gains under the tax‑free allowance. | — |
| **Regulatory Limits on Derivatives / Leveraged ETFs** | • Many EU countries restrict leveraged ETFs for custodial accounts. <br>• UK’s FCA prohibits leveraged products in Junior ISAs. | • Stick to unleveraged, broad‑based ETFs. Avoid products like QQQ‑LE or SPXL. | [17] |
| **Record‑Keeping & Reporting** | • Custodial account statements must be retained for at least 7 years. <br>• Annual tax declarations may be required if gains exceed threshold. | • Use digital tools or spreadsheets to track purchases, sales, dividends, and capital gains. | — |
| **Estate & Gift Tax Considerations** | • Assets in custodial accounts are part of the child's estate at birth. | • Consider setting up a Trust if the parent wishes to maintain control until a future date. | — |
